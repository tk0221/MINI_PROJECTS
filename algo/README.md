# Self Check-up

* Q1 - Create Subset of an array. (i.e. `[1,2]` -> `[[],[1],[2],[1,2]]`)
  * ans : https://repl.it/@tk0221/algo-q1
* Q2 - Letter comb
* Q3 - Search smallest element in arrays below
  * Unsorted array, like `[9,2,1,8,5,6,7,4,3]`
  * Sorted array `[1,2,3,4,5]`
  * Sorted array but shifted by n `[4,5,6,7,8,1,2,3]`
  * What is runtime for each case?
* Q4 - Find LCA(Least common ancestor) between two nodes in binary tree.
* Q5 - Find kth element in array. (i.e. `k = 3`, `arr = [6,3,2,5]` answer is 5)
